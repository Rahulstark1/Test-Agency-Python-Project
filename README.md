# Test Center Allocation Automation
This project automates the process of allocating test centers to candidates based on their location preferences, seat availability, and exam dates. It is designed to efficiently assign candidates to available centers while also generating reports for unallocated candidates and duplicate form submissions.

🚀 Features

📍 Candidate Allocation: Assigns candidates to their nearest preferred centers based on seat availability.

📅 Exam Date Management: Allows manual input of exam dates depending on candidate and seat requirements.

📊 Reports:

Allocated candidates with exam dates and centers.

Unallocated candidates due to seat unavailability.

Duplicate form submissions (candidates who filled the form multiple times).

📝 Data Processing: Built with Python and Pandas for efficient handling of large candidate datasets.

📌 Future Enhancements

Integration with SQL databases for real-world applications.

Web-based dashboard for live allocation updates.

Automated email/SMS notifications to candidates.
